# Local model validation

Verified on 2026-09-10 with Python 3.12.11 and the committed dependency lock.

- MaleCNS source files and prepared graph arrays match the upstream SHA-256 locks: 166,700 neurons, 25,582,938 directed connections, 3,335 mapped R1–R6 inputs and 811 mapped R8 inputs.
- From the same checkpoint following 1.5 s of white-input conditioning, a 100 ms white observation produced **127,378 spikes**, versus **92,952** for black input.
- A 200 ms control observation produced **0 PAM11 spikes**; the matched stimulated observation produced **261 PAM11 spikes**. After stimulation, **3,087 plastic edges** differed from their original baseline, and the weight array differed from the unstimulated control. This is a mechanism check, not a claim of learned preference or biological validity.
- Frozen plasticity preserved the saved weights despite reward-cell spiking.
- Restoring the checkpoint and replaying the control input produced the exact same spike hash.
- A real local HTTP worker received RGBA pixels, saved the corresponding RGB image exactly, delivered the requested 200 ms pulse over four observations, stopped receiving observations when paused, and saved a checkpoint at 250 ms neural time.
- Four fast Python checks cover pixel orientation/shape and local API validation, ownership, pause, and stimulation controls. Two full-network integration checks cover the above model and transport behaviors. Nine JavaScript checks cover presentation timing and the backend bridge, including no fabricated telemetry on disconnect.

Commands are in the root README. Full-network tests are opt-in because they require the separately downloaded dataset. Source syntax, module references, UI targets, HTTP serving, raw pixel transport, and the full numerical backend were checked. The optional WebMCP tool was registered successfully in the browser; its actions have not been interactively tested.

## Rendering regression — 2026-09-11

The local browser console reproduced a startup failure: the first `requestAnimationFrame` timestamp could precede the `performance.now()` value recorded during setup, passing a negative time step to playback and stopping the loop before the first render. The presentation clock now initializes from the first animation frame and bounds subsequent time steps. Pixel submission waits for a successfully rendered scene, and a rendering exception suspends visual input and shows a visible error.

All nine JavaScript checks passed, including the startup timestamp regression, repeated timestamps/suspended-tab gaps, and withholding frame requests when rendering is unavailable. In the actual local browser, the fly, overhead cable, and angled video screen rendered successfully; the exposure clock advanced, automatic and manual short changes worked, camera switching worked, and neural telemetry continued updating. No new browser errors appeared after the fix. These were browser/presentation changes; the numerical model was unchanged.

## Downloaded insect playlist — 2026-09-11

Ten fly/insect videos were downloaded with yt-dlp and prepared as H.264/AAC MP4s with FFmpeg. FFprobe verified their codecs, dimensions, and durations; all ten were visually checked. The playlist totals 353 seconds and occupies about 25 MB. Source titles, creators, URLs, and prepared-file hashes are recorded in `dist/media/playlist.json`.

In the local browser, actual moving insect footage rendered on the 3D phone and advanced automatically from the first clip through the second and third. Manual next worked while paused, and resume restarted the selected video. The original-audio toggle switched on and off without playback errors. The browser reported no errors or warnings during these checks.

The backend's saved 90×160 `latest-input.png` showed the same insect footage and portrait composition as the phone. Pausing held neural time at 193.20 seconds and preserved the input and spike hashes across subsequent status checks. Resuming advanced both video time and neural time, with new input hashes and measured spikes. Failed, loading, stale, or paused media is gated from the sensory stream; there is no synthetic-video fallback.

All 13 JavaScript checks passed, covering the retained clock/bridge behavior plus local-media cycling, paused manual changes, full-frame aspect fitting, stale-frame rejection, and skipping failed media. The numerical backend was unchanged, so the full-network assays above were not repeated for this presentation change. WebMCP status, pause, next-short, and resume actions were exercised successfully.

## Portrait Shorts with three-second swipes — 2026-09-11

The landscape playlist was replaced with ten native portrait YouTube Shorts. FFprobe verified all downloaded sources at 720×1280 and every prepared file at 360×640 with square pixels. All ten were visually checked. The downloader rejects landscape sources, and the player accepts only the prepared 9:16 dimensions, drawing directly to the phone without blurred filler.

The feed now advances at three seconds of played media time and wraps after ten clips. All 14 JavaScript checks passed, including just-before/at-three-second boundaries, timer reset for the next clip, and pausing at the boundary without advancing until resumed. In the local browser, the phone displayed full-height footage, the eighth short was playing at 23 seconds of exposure, and neural measurements continued updating. No browser errors or warnings appeared. The numerical backend and visual-input transport were unchanged.

## User-selected five-video playlist — 2026-09-11

The active playlist now contains only `HOe8Ur6H8x4`, `rUmhjdFVPFo`, `lYrSza4cYaE`, `db5JqXQekmE`, and `PBWmPoLjVvA`, in that order. All five downloaded successfully, were visually inspected, and verified at 360×640. The final prepared MP4 contains only the first four seconds; FFprobe reports exactly 4.000000 seconds. The downloader records the trim and reproduces it on later runs, including when cached output has a different duration.

The refreshed local browser showed the five-clip playlist, the selected fly footage, three-second automatic swipes, and continuing neural telemetry without browser errors. Playback and neural code were unchanged; validation focused on playlist identity/order, dimensions, file hashes, the four-second media cut, and a successful repeat preparation from the download cache.

## Scene overlays and motor response — 2026-09-11

The display now uses one large chamber with a neural overlay, larger typography, and no visible playback controls or current-video label. The overlay displays the measured whole-network firing rate, sample spike count, zero-based network activity graph, and existing 96-cell raster. Its graph records only new measured samples; disconnection clears the readings. Keyboard and WebMCP actions remain available.

An audit of 300 recent local samples found a median **61,731 spikes per 50 ms neural sample**, equivalent to **1,234,620 network spikes per simulated second**. Motor firing was nonzero in 204 samples, with median 5 Hz and maximum 30 Hz. PAM11 was nonzero in only one sample. The old prominent PAM11 reading therefore did not represent overall network activity.

The animation now maps those measured motor rates through a bounded response with faster attack and slower release, amplifying wing, body, and leg movement; signed turning activity moves the head smoothly. The numerical engine, visual-input transport, and stimulation policy are unchanged. All 17 JavaScript checks passed, including low-rate response, bounds, smooth decay, pause, direction, and preserving the input measurements. Browser inspection verified the larger overlay, removed controls and video label, rendered fly and phone, and no new errors. Pausing held exposure at 00:01:44, neural time at 278.00 seconds, and the sample count at 62,232; resuming restarted playback.
